### Educational Objectives

At the conclusion of the conference, participants should be able to: 

1. Explain changes in methodology and practice that are taking place in cytogenetics. 

2. Recognize opportunities provided by use of next generation sequencing, as well as develop understanding of challenges presented by that testing. 

3. Understand current and emerging use of molecular techniques in multiple organ systems, including the thyroid, breast cancer, hematolymphoid system, neuropathology, soft tissue pathology, and infectious disease. 

4. Recognize the major molecular alterations that characterize human tumors. 

5. Identify a key protein mutation in brain tumors that can be detected via immunohistochemistry. 

6. Recognize how a mutation in a gene can result in an abnormal localization of the corresponding protein. 

7. Recognize how different alterations in a gene can result in the same final common pathway of loss of protein expression. 

8. Understand how immunohistochemistry can be employed to detect chromosomal translocations that are specific for certain malignancies, e.g. alveolar soft part sarcoma. 

9. Recognize how immnohistochemistry can be integrated with fluorescence in situ hybridation to detect the presence of ALK alterations in lung adenocarcinoma.

### Statement of Need

This symposium will present recent advances in the field of molecular pathology. The presentation will emphasize the need for an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment, and will focus on recently described entities, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis and the impact of our diagnosis on prognosis and therapeutic procedures. 


### Accreditation
